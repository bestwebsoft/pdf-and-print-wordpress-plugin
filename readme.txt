== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Buttons for content do not appear on page =

Go to the Settings page and change value for the 'Add Button to' option.

= Why are PDF and Print buttons not displayed in the custom post type ? =

1. Please make sure that displaying of PDF/Print buttons is enabled for the necessary custom post type on the plugin settings page. If necessary, mark the checkboxes and save changes.
2. Check displaying the buttons on the specified pages in the front end of your site.

If buttons are still not displayed, please complete the following:

1. Try activating a standard WordPress theme for a while (Twenty Fifteen, Twenty Sixteen) and check if the problem remains.
2. Try deactivating all of your plugins except PDF & Print by BestWebsoft and also check if the problem is still present. If it is not, activate the plugins one-by-one, meanwhile checking, after which plugin activation the problem appears again.

Also, if you are using custom template you should paste the following string to the custom post or page template in order to use PDF and Print buttons:

- in the top of the post or page template

`<?php do_action( 'bwsplgns_display_pdf_print_buttons', 'top' ); ?>`

- in the bottom of the post or page template

`<?php do_action( 'bwsplgns_display_pdf_print_buttons', 'bottom' ); ?>`

You can specify some query parameters for your post. For example:

`<?php do_action( 'bwsplgns_display_pdf_print_buttons', 'bottom', 'post_type=gallery&orderby=post_date' ); ?>`

or

`<?php do_action( 'bwsplgns_display_pdf_print_buttons', 'bottom', array( 'post_type'=>'gallery', 'orderby'=>'post_date' ) ); ?>`

For more information on the syntax for assigning parameters to function see [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Parameters).

= Why in pdf/print-document displayed not all information from page =

For generating a pdf/print page version, PDF & Print plugin uses the content that is featured in the body of post/page before it is displayed by the browser (i.e. the data featured in the main block on this post/page in the edit mode).

= If I have shortcode on the page, but I don't want them to be printed (add to pdf) =

Go to the Settings page and unmark checkbox 'Print Shortcodes'.

= How can I change the content pdf/print document? =

You can use following filters if "Full Page PDF" option is disabled:

- in order to change main content of pdf/print document

`add_filter( 'bwsplgns_get_pdf_print_content', {your_function} );`

- in order to change top running title

`add_filter( 'bwsplgns_top_running_title', {your_function} );`

- in order to change bottom running title

`add_filter( 'bwsplgns_bottom_running_title', {your_function} );`

- in order to change the title of pdf/print document

`add_filter( 'bwsplgns_get_pdf_print_title', {your_function}, 10, 2 );`

For example, go to the plugin settings page -> "Custom Code" tab, mark "Activate custom PHP code." checkbox in the "PHP" section and add the following code:

`add_filter(
    'bwsplgns_get_pdf_print_content',
    function( $content ) {
        $my_content   = '<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>';
        $more_content = '<p>Donec fringilla libero ac sapien</p>';

        /* if you want add some data before to the main content */
        return $my_content . $content;

        /* if you want add some data after the main content */
        return $content . $my_content;

        /* if you want add some data both sides the main content */
        return $my_content . $content . $more_content;

        /* if you want add some data instead of the main content */
        return $my_content;
    }
);`

For more information about WordPress filters see [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter).

If "Full Page PDF" option is enabled please use `beforeImageToPdf()` and `afterImageToPdf()` JavaScript functions for changing PDF document.
For example, go to the plugin settings page -> "Custom Code" tab, mark "Activate custom JavaScript code." checkbox in the "JavaScript" section and add the following code:

`function beforeImageToPdf() {
    document.getElementById("site-header").style.display = "none";
}
function afterImageToPdf() {
    document.getElementById("site-header").style.display = "block";
}`

Replace "site-header" on the id of the element you need to hide.

= How can I add different styles to PDF and Print pages? =

To do that, go to Dashboard->PDF & Print->Output and mark "Custom CSS" checkbox. Enter the required styles in the "Custom CSS" field. You can use the class 'pdfprnt_print' in order to add some styles only for Print pages.

For example:

`body p {
	color: green;
}
.pdfprnt_print p {
	color: red;
}`

Also you can use filter 'bwsplgns_add_pdf_print_styles' to include additional css-files.

For example:

Let's imagine that you have files style.css, style_print.css and style_pdf.css and you want include them to your PDF or Print pages.

1. Upload these files to the folder 'wp-content/uploads' via FTP.
2. Go to the plugin settings page and open "Custom Code" tab.
2. Mark "Activate custom PHP code" checkbox in "PHP" section and insert the following code:

`add_filter(
	'bwsplgns_add_pdf_print_styles',
	function( $styles ) {
		$styles[] = array( 'wp-content/uploads/style_pdf.css', 'pdf' ); /* file will be included to PDF pages */
		$styles[] = array( 'wp-content/uploads/style_print.css', 'print' ); /* file will be included only to Print pages */
		$styles[] = array( 'wp-content/uploads/style.css' ); /* file will be included to PDF and Print pages */
		return $styles;
	}
);`

= I get an error "Warning: file_put_contents(/public_html/wp-content/plugins/pdf-print/mpdf/ttfontdata/dejavusanscondensed.GSUBGPOStables.dat): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /***/wp-content/plugins/pdf-print/mpdf/classes/ttfontsuni.php on line 1145". What can I do? =

Probably, you don't have sufficient access permissions to files and folders.

To solve this, please try the following:

1. using FTP, please go to the folder "/public_html/wp-content/plugins/pdf-print"
2. please check what permissions are set on the "mpdf" folder (755 must be set for the folder and 644 for files)
3. if there are another permissions set, please change them

For more info see [Changing File Permissions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions).

= How can I load additional fonts for MPDF library? =

Please follow the next steps:

1. Go to the plugin settings page
2. Switch to the "Output" tab
3. Find "Additional Fonts" option and click "Load Fonts" button

or

1. Download MPDF library by link https://github.com/lynxbee/mpdf
2. Using FTP, load the file mpdf-master.zip to the folder "{your_site_home_folder}/wp-content/uploads"
3. Go to the plugin settings page
4. Switch to the "Output" tab
5. Find "Additional Fonts" option and click "Load Fonts" button

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:

1. the link to the page where the problem occurs
2. the name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.
3. the version of your WordPress installation
4. copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://bestwebsoft.com/documentation/admin-panel-issues/system-status/)

= Can I remove content added by shortcodes? =

To remove the shortcode, please use 'bwsplgns_pdf_print_remove_shortcodes' hook:

1. Go to the plugin settings page;
2. Open "Custom Code" tab, mark "Activate custom PHP code." checkbox in the "PHP" section;
3. Add the following code (as example):

`function pdf_print_remove_shortcodes( $shortcodes_array ) {
    $shortcodes_array[] = 'bestwebsoft_contact_form';
    return $shortcodes_array;
}
add_filter( 'bwsplgns_pdf_print_remove_shortcodes', 'pdf_print_remove_shortcodes' );`

Replace `bestwebsoft_contact_form` with your shortcode.
